# Smart Job Portal

This is a frontend web application I built using React.js. It is a simple job portal where users can browse job listings, filter them, and view details. I focused on creating a clean user interface with a nice blue theme.

# About The Project

I created this project to practice my React skills. It simulates a real job search platform. Since this is a frontend-only project, it does not use a real database. The data is stored locally in the code.

#  Features

- Job Listing: Shows a list of available jobs with company names like Google, Amazon, and Flipkart.
- Search and Filter: You can search for jobs and filter them by Full-time or Half-time.
- Job Details: Clicking on a job shows more information about the role.
- Login and Signup: Simple forms to simulate user authentication.
- User Profile: A profile page where you can see and edit user details.
- Responsive Design: The website looks good on different screen sizes.
- Hover Effects: Buttons and cards have nice animations when you move your mouse over them.

#  Technologies Used

- React.js: Used for building the user interface and handling the logic.
- CSS3: Used for styling the website, adding colors, borders, and animations.
- HTML5: Used for the basic structure of the Website.
- JavaScript: Used for the functionality like filtering and navigation.
